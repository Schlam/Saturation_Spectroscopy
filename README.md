# Saturation Spectroscopy

In this report, the theory of fine and hyperfine structure of atomic energy levels
is developed.

We employed Doppler-Free spectroscopy methods to resolve the absorption
spectra of $\text{Rb}^{87}$ and $\text{Rb}^{85}$
which are typically obscured by doppler broadening effects.

We determine the central peak frequency by fitting the nonlinear model
we derived to our experimental data.
