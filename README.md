# Saturation Spectroscopy

In this report, the theory of fine and hyperfine structure of atomic energy levels
is developed.

We employed Doppler-Free spectroscopy methods to resolve the absorption
spectra of $^{87}Rb$ and $^{85}Rb$
which are typically obscured by doppler broadening effects.

The central peak frequency is observed by fitting our derived model
to experimental data with Gnuplot's Non Linear Least Squares method.
